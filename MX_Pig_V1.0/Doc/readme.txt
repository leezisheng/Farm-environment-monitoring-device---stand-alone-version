Project Descriptionï¼š

Nucleo-f103rb development board is used as the main controller to monitor hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, carbon dioxide, 
carbon monoxide concentrations, temperature, humidity and equipment voltage in pig farms through gas sensors, temperature 
and humidity sensors and internal voltage sensors. The ESP826601S module uses MQTT protocol to connect ali Cloud Iot platform 
to display and process data in real time.
